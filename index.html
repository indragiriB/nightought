        <h1> <span>*</span> My opinion on doom scroll</h1>
        <p>I think doom scroll is becoming a bad habbit that we should avoid. 
            imagine waking up, glued to your phone. 
            Phone is the first thing you grab after you wake up,
             how can this be more depressed?. 
            I think is that we as a human should take full control of ourselves.
            No matter how tempting our phone is, we have to say NO. Take a breathe, get your minds right.
